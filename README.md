## Recipes üçé

We got tired of putting together a grocery list every week since we have a backlog of go-to recipes. Instead of spending the weekend planning what we‚Äôre eating during the week, we wrote a script to automatically pull from our recipe list in Notion, assign meals onto days in our calendar, then add the ingredients onto our grocery list.

## Meetings üìÖ

We share a home office. It‚Äôs the worst when we accidentally talk over each other in conflicting meetings. We‚Äôll show you how to connect your meeting calendars to lights in your office, so you can quickly tell if someone‚Äôs in a call.

## Laundry üëó

We‚Äôre guilty of running and forgetting our laundry machine. Setting a timer is boring; we‚Äôre software engineers and we can do better. So, we attached a vibration sensor to track when the machine is running! We‚Äôll demonstrate how to plug in that sensor to a speaker, to notify you when the laundry‚Äôs done.
